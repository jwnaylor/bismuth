find email addresses at arbitrary domain

Sadly my solution failed to find the email addresses, using jana.com as the input domain.
I noticed they are present on a page that is not hyperlinked directly, although apparently loaded via client-side js.
If I use https://jana.com/static/views/contact/contact.html as the input the code finds the emails.
